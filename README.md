# Ecommerce Back End

## Description

This project was to practice working with Sequelize and MySQL2 to design the back-end server, models, and routes for an Ecommerce site. I set up a number of models with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, then created CRUD operations for these tables, run through Sequelize over a local server. 

## Installation

Download all files, run npm i, npm run seed, and npm start. Operations can be performed through Insomnia Core. Create the database using the schema in the db folder by running the code in MySQL Workbench.
